Keyboard shortcuts for WordPress

## Status ##

This plugin is currently a proof of concept more than anything else. The plugin is (hopefully) built so that other plugins can easily add their own shortcuts.

The plugin uses [Mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap/) for the actual keyboard shortcut functionality, but this may change due to licensing incompatibility. The plugin abstracts this away though, so changing the library at a later date won't be too much of an issue.

## Current Shortcuts ##

The "meta" key is <kbd>cmd</kbd> on a Mac and <kbd>ctrl</kbd> on Windows and Linux. See the [Mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap/) docs for more info.

Work anywhere:

 * <kbd>+ p</kbd> - Add new Post.
 * <kbd>+ a</kbd> - Add new Page.
 * <kbd>+ m</kbd> - Add new Media.
 * <kbd>+ u</kbd> - Add new User.
 * <kbd>meta+h</kbd> - Toggles WordPress' built-in Help panel.

Contextual:

 * <kbd>+ +</kbd> (That's the plus key twice) - Contextual Add New - works for posts, media, terms, users, network sites).
 * <kbd>meta+s</kbd> - Contextual Save - works for posts, comments, terms, users).
